Created this repository to journal all the tricks of data visualization I learnt throught practical experience. 

The flow of this repository would be as follows:
  - a stakeholder's request for something specific
  - brief description of how to fulfill this request
  - step by step process breakdown

Hoping that this helps fellow individuals in the field of data analytics.
