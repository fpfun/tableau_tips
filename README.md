# tableau_tips
Created this repository to journal all the tricks of data visualization I learnt throught practical experience. 

The flow of this repository would be as follows:
  - a stakeholder's request for something specific
  - brief description of how to fulfill this request
  - step by step process breakdown

Hoping that this helps fellow individuals in the field of data analytics. 

Date Filters 

[Custom Date Filter](https://github.com/fpfun/tableau_tips/blob/main/Custom_Date_Filter) - Upon a dashboard's pop up it should display data from a preset date range but would later allow a stakeholder to choose.
